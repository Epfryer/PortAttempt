# GitHub Copilot Task List for Inline Project Transitions

### **1. Create the Base Layout**
- Ask Copilot to:
  - Build a **flexible vertical layout** for project tiles.
  - Use **CSS Grid** or **Flexbox** for alignment and spacing.
  - Add placeholder elements for project titles, descriptions, and thumbnails.

Example Request:
> Create a vertical layout for project tiles using CSS Grid with placeholder content for titles, descriptions, and images.

---

### **2. Implement the Expandable Tile Component**
- Ask Copilot to:
  - Create a **ProjectTile component** with a state variable (e.g., `isExpanded`).
  - Add a `click` event handler to toggle between expanded and collapsed states.
  - Apply smooth transitions for height and content visibility.

Example Request:
> Build a ProjectTile component that expands vertically on click, using state management for toggling and smooth CSS transitions.

---

### **3. Add Conditional Rendering for Expanded Content**
- Ask Copilot to:
  - Render additional content (e.g., gallery, detailed descriptions) inside the expanded project tile.
  - Ensure that expanded content is hidden in the collapsed state.

Example Request:
> Add conditional rendering to display additional content in the ProjectTile component when the `isExpanded` state is true.

---

### **4. Smooth Scroll to Focus**
- Ask Copilot to:
  - Automatically scroll the expanded tile into view when clicked.
  - Use `scrollIntoView` with smooth scrolling behavior.

Example Request:
> Add a smooth scroll function to bring the clicked ProjectTile into the center of the viewport.

---

### **5. Implement Horizontal Scrolling for Galleries**
- Ask Copilot to:
  - Create a horizontal gallery for the expanded project.
  - Add navigation arrows for scrolling left and right.
  - Ensure smooth scrolling using `scrollBy` and CSS.

Example Request:
> Create a horizontal gallery inside the expanded ProjectTile with left and right navigation arrows and smooth scrolling.

---

### **6. Make Layout Responsive**
- Ask Copilot to:
  - Add media queries to adjust the layout for mobile devices.
  - Convert the horizontal gallery into a vertical stack for smaller screens.

Example Request:
> Add responsive styles to the ProjectTile and gallery, stacking the content vertically for mobile devices.

---

### **7. Add Hover Effects for Interactivity**
- Ask Copilot to:
  - Add hover effects for project thumbnails and navigation arrows.
  - Include subtle animations like scale or color change.

Example Request:
> Add hover effects to the ProjectTile thumbnails and navigation arrows for better interactivity.

---

### **8. Optimize Performance**
- Ask Copilot to:
  - Lazy-load images in the gallery to improve page performance.
  - Minimize animations to reduce resource usage on low-power devices.

Example Request:
> Add lazy loading for gallery images inside ProjectTile to improve performance.

By following these tasks in order, you can guide GitHub Copilot to build the desired inline transition functionality incrementally and efficiently. Let me know if you'd like to prioritize any specific step or need further refinements!
